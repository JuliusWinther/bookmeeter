## 📚 BookMeeter
BookMeeter is a mobile application developed in Dart and Flutter, designed to be a mix between a social network and a marketplace for book lovers. The idea behind BookMeeter was to allow users to sell, trade, and discuss their used books within a community of reading enthusiasts.

## 🚨 Project Status: Indefinitely Suspended
The project is currently suspended indefinitely. Although the foundational pieces of the user interface (UI) have been developed, the project was halted before the main features were completed. As a result, BookMeeter will remain in this state until a decision is made to resume work in the future.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
    Dart: The programming language used for developing the app.
    Flutter: The framework used to build native user interfaces for iOS and Android from a single codebase.

## 📝 Contributing
